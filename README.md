# Cobalt Language Organization

Welcome to the Cobalt programming language's organization page! We host the source code for:

- Cobalt (the language + CLI tools)
- Cobalt docs
- Some small fun projects made in Cobalt
- and more!

If you look right now, you'll
notice that it's pretty empty. Cobalt is in active development!

## What is Cobalt?

Cobalt is a strongly typed interpreted programming language written in Rust. It has syntax similar to TypeScript, Go, and Rust.
